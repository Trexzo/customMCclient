# Architecture

## Foundation rules

The project is launcher-owned and version-aware. Minecraft integration is deliberately kept outside the core.

### Modules

- `launcher` — process/runtime ownership, installation discovery, metadata resolution, integrity checks, native staging, command construction and launch preflight.
- `core` — version-independent events, modules, settings, lifecycle and services.
- `platform-api` — narrow contract between the core and a game-version adapter.
- `platform-1.8.9` — version-specific in-process adapter boundary for Minecraft 1.8.9.

## Bytecode boundary

`launcher` is built with Java 21.

`core`, `platform-api` and `platform-1.8.9` compile with `--release 8`. This preserves compatibility with a legacy-compatible in-process runtime while the launcher uses a modern JVM.

## Explicit ownership

Foundation state is explicit:

- `ModuleRegistry` owns module identity.
- `ModuleController` owns module lifecycle state and exposes failed transitions instead of hiding them.
- `ModuleKeybindRegistry` owns optional module-to-key-chord associations; `ModuleKeybindController` translates bound presses into the existing lifecycle authority.
- `ServiceRegistry` owns shared cross-module services by contract type.
- `EventBus` returns explicit subscriptions that must be closed.
- `PlatformContext` receives these owners rather than discovering global state.
- each `GamePlatform` has an explicit attach/detach lifecycle.

Module key chords are backend-neutral stable key ids plus Shift/Control/Alt flags. A module may own at most one active chord and a chord may target at most one module. Closing the registration releases only that association. Keybind presses never invoke module callbacks directly; they route through `ModuleController`, including the existing `FAILED -> disable` cleanup path.

The permanent architecture must avoid:

- reflection-based module discovery;
- generated event-bus source;
- global mutable singleton state without lifecycle ownership;
- config writes hidden inside setting/module setters;
- a browser engine as a mandatory ClickGUI dependency;
- JNI/JVMTI injection when the launcher already owns process creation.

## Minecraft 1.8.9 boundary

M8 establishes `platform-1.8.9` without importing or committing Mojang classes.

The adapter owns only the version-specific in-process boundary. Hooks publish typed events into the core through `PlatformContext`. Later integration work may bind those hooks to the actual game runtime, but Minecraft implementation types must not leak into `core`.

## Rendering direction

Rendering is not implemented yet. The planned design is a staged renderer with cached frame data and explicit render passes. UI and effects must be measurable independently.

## Minecraft acquisition

The repository does not contain Mojang/Minecraft source or game binaries. The launcher resolves and verifies a legitimate installed runtime before launch.

## Module input direction

M48 establishes the core module-keybind authority without coupling it to ClickGUI or Minecraft input classes. The core controller accepts a deliberate chord press and owns only bind lookup plus lifecycle routing.

M49 adds `Minecraft189ModuleKeybindRuntime`, which publishes one `ModuleKeybindController` through the attached platform `ServiceRegistry` with an explicit managed lifetime. `Minecraft189InputHooks.key(...)` gives an installed ClickGUI first chance to consume the translated event, suppresses module binds while that ClickGUI model is open, ignores repeat/release for module activation, then translates the remaining press into a `ModuleKeyChord` using the existing backend-neutral key id and modifier flags. Keybind routing therefore works even when ClickGUI is not installed, and runtime teardown removes only the keybind service.
